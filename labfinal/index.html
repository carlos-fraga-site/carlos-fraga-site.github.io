	<p>Light switches are what illuminates a home, some what argue that lights and bulbs are what serve this purpose but what controls the light is the switch. A switch is an electrical device that is utilized to operate electrical appliances by providing them with the desired power that is necessary to run a specific appliance. When you ‘switch on’ an appliance, the electrical circuit is completed, and the product starts receiving electrical supply.</p>
